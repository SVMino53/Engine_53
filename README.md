# Engine53
## Created by Isak "Mino53" Forsberg

This is a game engine I am developing in my free time, both as a fun challenge for myself, and to improve my knowledge about computer graphic, audio and interface.

The engine is still in a very early state and not currently useful for making any games or applications. Once it gets to a state where it can be used as a tool for other projects, this document will be updated.
